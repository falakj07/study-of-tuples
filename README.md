## Title :
Tuples in Python: Creation, Access, and Operations

## Aim :
To study the concept of tuples in Python and perform various operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, and applying built-in functions.

## Objectives: 
To understand what tuples are in Python 
To learn the properties and benefits of tuples 
To practice accessing elements using indexing and slicing 
To use built-in functions related to tuples 
To understand the immutability property of tuples



## Theory:

1.	Introduction to Tuples
A tuple is a sequence of values stored in a specific order, similar to a list, but it cannot be modified after creation. Tuples are represented using parentheses ( ) with elements separated by commas.
Example:
(5, 15, 25)

2.	Features of Tuples
• Maintains order of elements
• Supports indexing
• Immutable in nature
• Permits duplicate elements
• Can hold different types of data

3.	Applications of Tuples
• Executes faster compared to lists
• Ensures data safety as values cannot be altered
• Suitable for constant data like RGB values, coordinates, and fixed records

4.	Tuple Creation Methods
5.	Tuples can be created in multiple ways:
• Using parentheses
• Without parentheses (packing)
• Using tuple() function
Special Case:
A tuple with one element must include a comma
(7,)

5.	Tuple Indexing
Elements in a tuple can be accessed using their position number, starting from index 0.
Supported indexing methods:
• Positive indexing
• Negative indexing

6.	Tuple Slicing
Slicing allows extraction of a subset of elements from a tuple.
Syntax:
tuple_name[start : stop : step]
Explanation:
• start → starting index (included)
• stop → ending index (excluded)
• step → interval between elements (optional)

7.	Immutability of Tuples
After a tuple is defined:
• Elements cannot be inserted
• Elements cannot be deleted
• Elements cannot be modified
Any modification attempt will raise an error.

8.	Tuple Built-in Functions
Function	Description
len()	Returns total number of elements
max()	Returns largest element
min()	Returns smallest element
sum()	Calculates sum of elements
count()	Counts occurrences of an element
index()	Returns index of first occurrence

## Comparison Between List and Tuple

List	         Tuple

Mutable	       Immutable

Uses [ ]       Uses ( )

Slower	        Faster

Flexible        Fixed size
size

## Conclusion: Hence, tuples in Python were studied in detail and operations such as creation, indexing, slicing, packing, unpacking, and usage of built-in functions were performed successfully.
